## 0.3.0 - 2018-05-14

* Update LibreHardwareMonitor to [3460ec](https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor/tree/3460ec7fb27a4c9ac1aec6512364340c4bd38004)
  * Support for NCT6792D (X99)
* Add opt-in to [Graphite tag support](http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tags.html)
* Add [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) support

This release is backwards compatible. For those interested in Graphite tags -- they are not backwards compatible! While tagged metrics will have the same name as pre-tagged OhmGraphite metrics, Graphite will treat them separately. So one can either merge these metrics or start over.

## 0.2.1 - 2018-05-03

Bugfix for users where their computer culture doesn't use a period `.` as the decimal separator resulting in warnings and no data being stored.

## 0.2.0 - 2018-04-02

Huge shout out to @jonasbleyl who discovered a whole swath of hardware metrics that can be reported!

* Report sub-hardware sensors. For those missing motherboard temperatures, fan controllers, and voltage metrics -- those should now be reported.
* Change logging of sensors without a value from warning to debug as fan controllers often don't have a value and we want to prevent log spam.

## 0.1.3 - 2018-03-07

* Increase logging done under `DEBUG` to aid diagnostics
* Ease upgrades by packing everything into `OhmGraphite.exe`. No need for the .dll files anymore. Upgrading now consists solely of replacing the executable.
